 I am currently a third year Ph.D. candidate in the Duke University Department of Statistical Science where I am advised by Dr. Alex Volfovsky. 

 Broadly, I am interested in research at the intersection of causal inference and natural language processing with applications in the social sciences, and I conduct applied studies in the Duke Polarization Lab to better understand interactions on social networks.

 Before being at Duke, I did my undergraduate degree in Math and Computer Science and the University of Alabama. I then spent a year in Kinmen, Taiwan as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant. 

 Outside of work, I love dancing (especially ballet), swimming, long walks, and eating any kind of sweet treat.
